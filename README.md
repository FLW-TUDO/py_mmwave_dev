# Python mmWave Sensor Toolbox

## Introduction
This toolbox provides a python toolbox to read and visualize the measurement of Texas Instrument (TI) mmWave Radar Sensor IWR 6843 ISK. The toolbox offers straightforward access to specific OOB firmware versions included in TI's mmWave SDKs and Industrial Toolboxes, emphasizing data capture and visualization with Python 3.

## Features
This toolbox consists of three different functionalities:

* py_mmwave_read: serial reader and data logger for the mmWave Sensor
* py_mmwave_visualizer: modified version of pymmw toolbox from https://github.com/m6c7l/pymmw to visualize mmWave sensor reading in real-time (many Old library dependencies)
* py_mmwave_plot: plot toolbox to visualize the data logger measurement from text files

## Support 

* IWR6843 ES2.0
  * mmWave SDK Demo (SDK 3.5.0.4)

> Compatible to connect directly to the IWR6843 or board carrier board (i.e. MMWAVEICBOOST).
